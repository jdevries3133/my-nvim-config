# My nvim Config

All colors taken from
[flazz/vim-colorschemes](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes).

Remember to install [vim-plugged](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
and run `:PlugInstall` to install plugins specified in `init.vim`.

I also use several coc.nvim extensions. They are installed with
`:CocInstall [name]`. All the extensions I use are listed in
`coc-extensions.json`, which is syslinked from this repo to
`~/.config/coc/extensions/package.json`.
